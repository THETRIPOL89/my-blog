    Here we are. I'm writing about me, and you're reading about me. I want to tell you something
    that you need to remember btw when reading my blogs: it's not about me, it's about you...
    And with that, I mean you should implement the tools that I, either implicitly or explicitly,
    give you. Certainly I'll be writing about me, some parts of the books that I read, and
    other things, but the main reason of this blog is to let you learn more. This is my idea
    and I hope you'll enjoy reading the posts and I hope you'll agree with this preface.

    First of all, let me tell you my identity. My name is Federico and I'm a 16 yo young student.
    I'm currently studing in High-School of Languages at the 3rd year. I actually enjoy it, but I
    prefer learning Computer Science. In the last five years, I've learned a lot more about CS
    and I've discovered that I'm really keen on this subject. Now I'll tell you about the story of
    my learning adventure, going through all the highs and lows, the useful and useless stuff.
    Fell free to skip this part if you're not interested in.

    It all started for jealousy. A friend of mine pretended to be a computer genius in the
    middle schools. At the time I believed what he said was true. So I decided to study Computer
    Programming to be like him. It's fun now thinking that he was capping and I got passionate
    thanks to lies and jealousy. A very strange starting. However, I began to study Computer.
    I downloaded a book, don't remember the name, but it was a easy-peasy book about Computers's History,
    Computers's Components and an introduction to Programming.

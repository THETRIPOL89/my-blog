Hi Lerner, great to see you!<br>
Reading this post you'll learn some practical tips and tools you can apply to your life that I've been taught by Dario Silvestri, an entrepreneur who succeed in life and helped me reach my goals and defeat my fears.<br>

The first thing I've learned from Mr. Dario Silvestri is that everything moves. Heraclitus, a philosophy of the Ancient Greeks, already in the 5th century B.C. had this idea that everything changes and he called it _pantarei_.

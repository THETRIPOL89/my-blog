Hi Lerner, great to see you!<br>
Reading this post you'll learn some practical tips and tools you can apply to your life that I've been taught by Dario Silvestri, an entrepreneur who succeed in life and helped me reach my goals and defeat my fears.<br>

#### 1:) Pantarei
The first thing I've learned from Mr. Dario Silvestri is that everything moves. Heraclitus, a philosophy of the Ancient Greeks, already in the 5th century B.C. had this idea that everything changes and he called it _pantarei_. The main idea here is that you can't just stand still and hope things will get better. If you just stand everything is going to worsen. Therefore the only way to get better is to act. This is really a powerful thought. I was stunned by this idea the first time I heard it. I never thought about it but it's actually real. So, my advice for you is simple: **ACT**.

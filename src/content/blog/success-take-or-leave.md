Hi Lerner, great to see you!<br>
Reading this post you'll learn some practical tips and tools you can apply to your life that I've been taught by Dario Silvestri, an entrepreneur who succeed in life and helped me reach my goals and defeat my fears.<br>

#### I) Pantarei
The first thing I've learned from Mr. Dario Silvestri is that everything moves. Heraclitus, a philosophy of the Ancient Greeks, already in the 5th century B.C. had this idea that everything changes and he called it _pantarei_. The main idea here is that you can't just stand still and hope things will get better. If you just stand everything is going to worsen. Therefore the only way to get better is to act. This is really a powerful thought. I was stunned by this idea the first time I heard it. I never thought about it but it's actually real. So, my advice for you is simple: **ACT**.<br>

#### II) Take it or Leave it
Maybe sometimes you wonder whether you should or not do something: well, let me tell you the secret: "If that thing makes you improve then **do it, else QUIT**." You don't need to think about it too much time, just ask yourself if it's really worth doing it. Take it or Leave it. Also, don't try to please everyone else. We always please someone else's desires, tasks, and opinions they have on us. **STOP THAT**. You just need to please your fucking self.<br>

#### III) Don't wait
The time is not unlimited. We're all going to die before you may realize it. Life is short, man; even if you've lived for one hundred years, that's a short life. Time is precious. Don't waste your time trying to pursue things that aren't worth your time. End NOW relationships causing you to be awful, sad, down, or even judged. Fuck it. FUCK THEM. The sand is fastly shifting side to side in the sand glass. The clock is ticking, dude: take control over your life, and spend your freaking limited time in the way you want and not in the way others want you to use and want you to be.<br>

#### IV) Be brave
Be brave. This is the key to a successful life. You have to cross that door, that's blocking you and making you seem and act like a shy guy. Smash through that door. And to all those people who're highlighting your fears, just say fuck. Everybody has scars and fears. You must understand that's completely normal. However, you have to turn those fears into fuel for your powerfulness. How? Being brave.<br>

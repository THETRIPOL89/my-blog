Sigmund Freud is one of the greatest philosophers of all time, and with this little post, I hope I'll let you understand this. Reading, you'll find the main concepts he developed during his life. In addition, you'll learn how his view of the world can help you in your personal life.

#### The Structure of Personality
This concept is really theoretical. Feel free to skip it if you're not interested. The human personality is composed of three components: the Id, Super-Ego, and Ego. The Id represents the human desire for pleasure without any restrictions. The Super-Ego contains every social interdiction instilled in us as a child. Finally, the Ego is the organized part, whose task is to equilibrate Id and Super-Ego.

#### The Unconscious Mind
So, what's this unconscious mind? To put it easy, it's the most prevalent part of our mind. Let me clarify. The human _psyche_ (brain) is mainly composed of two parts (according to Freud): a conscious and an unconscious one. Well, Freud supposed that the unaware section was the predominant one. But what exactly does the Unconscious? As Freud said, it contains all unintentional actions, thoughts, and feelings while influencing our behavior. However, with psychoanalysis, Freud's invention, men can discover and rule these unwitting affairs. Indeed, it's pretty simple to accomplish this: you only need to relax and let your thoughts wander. That's everything you need to do. Freud explains then how the Unconscious occurs. Freud declares that this part of the mind shows up during our dreams. In fact, through dreams, we can interpret the Id's will.
That's because in dreams there are no limiting borders. Therefore we can catch that desire while imposing ourselves no beliefs. Here's the conceptual idea of "The Interpretation of Dreams" by Sigmund Freud.

### How can we adopt to our lives the ideas above explained?
**Journaling**. WAIT WAIT, I know. You may ask "How can journaling be related to Sigmund Freud?" Well, whether you believe it or not, it is. I'll explain to you why. Journaling (in its correct form) should be a _register of one's daily thoughts and feelings_. So, while you journal, you're letting your mind wander among all the ideas you've got in your mind. And wait a second, isn't that what Freud tells us to do? Yup, it is. Thereby, you have to do one more thing: start journaling.

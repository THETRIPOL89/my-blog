Well, I play chess. I've loved it since the first time I played it.
The Scandinavian opening is a **gambit opening**, that trades the e5 black pawn in order to get a much powerful control of the center.

#### First game I learned

`Jan Timman` as White<br>
`Mustafa Ahmed Bakali` as Black<br>
Nice 1974<br>

1: e4, d5 _(Scandinavian opening is characterized by d5)_<br>
2: exd5, Kf6<br>
3: d4, Kxd5<br>
4: c4, Kb6<br>
5: Kf3, Bg4<br>
6: c5!, Kd5?<br>

<br>
<br>

7: Qb3!, b6?<br>
8: Ke5!<br>

Now what happens on 8: .., Be6 ?<br>

9: Bb5+, c6<br>
10: Kxc6!<br>

Here the game is lost for Black.

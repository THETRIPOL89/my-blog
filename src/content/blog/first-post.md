Well, I play chess. I've loved it since the first time I played it.
The Scandinavian opening is a **gambit opening**, that trades the e5 black pawn in order to get a much powerful control of the center.

#### First game I learned

`Jan Timman` as White<br>
`Mustafa Ahmed Bakali` as Black<br>
Nice 1974<br>

1: e4, d5 _(Scandinavian opening is characterized by d5)_<br>
2: exd5, Kf6<br>
3: d4, Kxd5<br>
4: c4, Kb6<br>
5: Kf3, Bg4<br>
6: c5!, Kd5?<br>

<br>

7: Qb3!, b6?<br>
8: Ke5!<br>

Now what happens on 8: .., Be6 ?<br>

9: Bb5+, c6<br>
10: Kxc6!<br>

Here the game is lost for Black.<br>


So, this was a Scandinavian game example. I recommend you try this opening if you're playing as Black against e4 because not everyone may know this line, and if your opponent falls into this trap, you're going to win. Give it a try. I think I'm going to write about this topic (chess) in some other posts.

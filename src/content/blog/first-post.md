Well, I play chess. I've loved it since the first time I played it.
The Scandinavian opening is a **gambit opening**, that trades the e5 black pawn in order to get a much powerful control of the center.

#### First game I learned

_Jan Timman_ as White
_Mustafa Ahmed Bakali_ as Black
Nice 1974

1: e4, d5 `Scandinavian opening is characterized by d5`<br>
2: exd5, Kf6<br>
3: d4, Kxd5<br>
4: c4

Well, I play chess. I've loved it since the first time I played it.
The Scandinavian opening is a **gambit opening**, that trades the e5 black pawn in order to get a much powerful control of the center.

#### First game I learned

`Jan Timman` as White<br>
`Mustafa Ahmed Bakali` as Black<br>
Nice 1974<br>

1: e4, d5 _Scandinavian opening is characterized by d5_<br>
2: exd5, Kf6<br>
3: d4, Kxd5<br>
4: c4, Kb6<br>
5: Kf3, Bg4<br>
6: c5!, Kd5?<br>

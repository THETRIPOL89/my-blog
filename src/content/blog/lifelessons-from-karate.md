I've been practicing Karate for a while now, a total of four years, and these are the meaningful lessons I've learned. Little premise: don't judge the things you're going to read with bias. Just read the text and reflect on the advice I give you. Another last thing: I am not a master... So, don't take everything for granted. Truly understand the lessons I'm sharing with you, and only if you agree with them, try to apply them in your life to become a better version of yourself.

#### The art of perfection
My _Sensei_ (master) from the very beginning taught me this important and central rule: Karate is an art, and as an art, to get talented you need to improve little by little without stopping. **Every improvement counts**. However, you need and have to get better every single day. That's rule number one. If you've just remembered one thing after reading this text, please remember this: little by little one travels far. And in Karate this is so much true. But not only does this kind of art support this rule; many others do. And as you enhance your skill constantly, you also get closer to perfection. That's the key to being the best.

#### Dojo
Another significant lesson my master has instructed me is not to criticize other's victories. Instead, be grateful and cheerful to have them in your Dojo. Try to learn from their triumphs and failures. This key is summarizable with a simple but efficient phrase: do not be selfish. That's everything you need to know if you are looking for no issues for the rest of your life. Having that said, I'd like to add that Dojo is brotherhood and love together. That's what we should apply in every valuable relationship.

#### Discipline
And as you may have thought, Karate confers a great deal of discipline. Every time I step into the Dojo, I must do the OSS, that is to say, the salutation karatekas do. Not only when I get in, but also when I leave. As if that weren't enough, I must obey and follow every instruction my Sensei commands us. Still, I love this art because of many remarkable aspects, but one of these is undoubtedly the discipline Karate taught me. Before I started practicing it, I wasn't at all disciplined. Sooner, as I became acquainted with the various facets of this magnificent art, I became a quieter and more controlled person. Again, being a calm and temperate human being in these times it's one of the most crucial features one can possess.

Despite these three essential aspects, many more are enlightened in a Japanese Dojo. Yet, I hope you have appreciated your lecture while trying to convey the greatness and magnificence of the Japanese world.

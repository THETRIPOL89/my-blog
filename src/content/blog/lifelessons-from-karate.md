I've been practicing Karate for a while now, a total of four years, and these are the meaningful lessons I've learned. Little premise: don't judge with bias the things you're going to read. Just read the text and reflect on the advice I give you. Another last thing: I am not a master... So, don't take everything for granted. Truly understand the lessons I'm sharing with you, and only if you agree with them, try to apply them in your life to become a better version of yourself.

#### The art of perfection
My _Sensei_ (master) from the very beginning taught me this important and central rule: Karate is an art, and as an art, in order to get talented you need to improve little by little without stopping. Every improvement counts. However, you need and have to get better every single day. That's rule number one. If you've just remembered one thing after reading this text, please remember this: little by little one travels far. And in Karate this is so much true. But not only does this kind of art support this rule; many others do. And as you enhance your skill constantly, you also get closer to perfection. That's the key to being the best.
